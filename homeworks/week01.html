    <h1>What is statistics, and why can it be useful for cybersecurity?</h1>

        Current security methods adopted for enterprise and ad hoc networks can be improved by applying advanced statistical and machine learning (ML) techniques that adaptively and quickly detect attacks. Networked systems are increasingly being instrumented with data monitoring, both at the edge and within-network, which has created a wealth of data traces with which statistical machine learning approaches can integrate diverse information to better detect, track, and understand attacks.
